FaP - Functional and Programing
===============================

`FaP` is a simple functional programming inspired by Haskell.

It only purpose is to improve my (maybe yours !) understanding of functional
programming. Nothing more.

`fap` (lowercase) is the compiler implementation.


Everything is under WTFPL license, how could it be otherwise ? ;-)

FAP - FunctionAl and Programing
===============================

`FAP` is a simple functional programming inspired by Haskell.

It only purpose is to improve my (maybe yours !) understanding of functional
programming. Nothing more.

- `fapc` is the compiler implementation.
- `fapi` is the interpreter

Everything is under WTFPLv2 license, how could it be otherwise ? ;-)

Work in progress:

- [X] (Grammar) Arithmetical/Boolean operators
- [X] (Grammar) Function and lambda definition
- [X] (Grammar) Comments, variable, strings
- [X] AST generation
- [X] Interpreter command line
- [ ] (Grammar) Typing system
- [ ] `let` keyword and assignation
- [ ] std lib
- [ ] Compiler frontend
- [ ] Compiler backend
